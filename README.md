- Github repo for the project 
- file with tidy data derrived from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- codebook
- readme file
- R script file titled run_analysis.R transforming the original dataset into the derrived tidy dataset
- the submited files are of my own work

## run_analysis.R script objectives

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
